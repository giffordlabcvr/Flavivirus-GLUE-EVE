		 This is <b>Flavivirid-GLUE</b>, a
		 <a target="_blank" href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/"><b>GLUE</b></a>
		 project for the 
		 <a target="_blank" href="https://viralzone.expasy.org/43"><b>flavivirids</b></a>
		 (family <i>Flaviviridae</i>).		 
	   </p>

	   <p>
		 The <i>Flaviviridae</i> comprise enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses,
		 many of which pose serious risks to human health on a global scale. 
		 Arthropod-borne flaviviruses such as Zika virus (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html"><b>ZIKV</b></a>),
		 Dengue virus (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/index.html"><b>DENV</b></a>), and
		 yellow fever virus (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/index.html"><b>YFV</b></a>)
		 are the causative agents of large-scale outbreaks that result
		 in millions of human infections every year, while the bloodborne hepatitis C virus
		 (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-c"><b>HCV</b></a>)
		 is a major cause of chronic liver disease.

		 Projected urbanisation in 2027 (from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.economist.com/node/21642053">The Economist</a> magazine).
		 Urbanisation is often associated with the emergence and spread of mosquito-borne diseases
		 by creating favourable conditions for the survival of mosquito vector species.
		 Genome data can directly inform efforts to control diseases caused by mosquito-borne flaviviruses.

	   <br>

  
	   <p>
		 Since the emergence of the SARS-COV2 pandemic, many have become familiar with 
		 the use of <b>virus genome data</b>  to track the spread and evolution of pathogenic viruses
		 - e.g. via tools such as <a target="_blank" href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global""><b>NextStrain</b></a>. 
		 However, it is less widely appreciated that the same kinds of data sets and comparative genomic approaches
		 can also be used to explore the structural and functional basis of virus adaptations. 
	   </p>

	   <p>	   
		 The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools"><b>GLUE software framework</b></a>
		 provides an extensible platform for implementing computational genomic
		 analysis of viruses in an <b>efficient, standardised and reproducible</b> way.
         <b>GLUE projects</b> can not only incorporate all of the data items typically used in
         comparative genomic analysis
         (e.g. sequences, alignments, genome feature annotations) but can also represent the complex
         semantic links between these data items via a <b>relational database</b>.
         This 'poises' sequences and associated data for application in computational
         analysis, minimising the requirement for labour-intensive pre-processing of datasets.
	   </p>

	   <p>
		 GLUE projects are equally suited for carrying out exploratory work 
		 (e.g. using virus genome data to investigate structural and functional properties of viruses)
		 as they are for implementing operational procedures (e.g. producing
		 <a target="_blank" href="http://hcv-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/exampleReports/resistanceGeno1.html?hcvGlueVersion=0.1.68""><b>standardised reports</b></a>
		 in a public or animal health setting).
	   </p>      


	   <p>
		 Hosting of GLUE projects in an online version control system (e.g. <b>GitHub</b>) provides
		 a mechanism for their stable, collaborative development, as shown below.

	   <p>
		 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools"><b>GLUE</b></a> is an open, integrated
		 software toolkit that provides functionality for storage and interpretation of
		 sequence data. It supports the development of <b>“projects”</b> containing the data items
		 required for comparative genomic analysis 
		 (e.g.  sequences, multiple sequence alignments, genome feature annotations,
		 and other sequence-associated data). 
	   </p>


        <br>
        <p><img src="./website/assets/images/glue-framework.jpg" alt="GLUE framework figure" /></p>
        <br>


	   <p>
		 Projects are loaded into the <b>GLUE "engine"</b>, creating a <b>relational database</b>
		 that represents the semantic relationships between data items.
		 This provides a robust foundation for the implementation of <b>systematic
		 comparative analyses</b> and the development of <b>sequence-based resources</b>. 
		 The database schema can be extended to accommodate the idiosyncrasies of different projects.
		 GLUE provides a scripting layer (based on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.javascript.com/"><b>JavaScript</b></a>)
		 for developing custom analysis tools.

	   <a id="WhyGlueProject" class="anchor" href="#glueProject" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>What does building the Flavivirid-GLUE project offer?</strong>
	   </h3>
	   <hr>

		 
 	   
	   <p>
	   
		 <b>Flavivirid-GLUE</b> contains aligned, annotated reference genome sequences for all
		 <a href="./website/html/viruses.html">flavivirid</a> species and
		 <a href="./website/html/paleoviruses.html">endogenous viral elements (EVEs)</a> derived from flavivirids.
		 
          It offers a number of advantages for performing comparative sequence
		  analysis of flavivirids:


		  <ol>

			<li> <strong>Reproducibility</strong>. 
			For many reasons, bioinformatics analyses are notoriously difficult to reproduce.
			The GLUE framework supports the implementation of fully reproducible 
			comparative genomics through the introduction of data standards and the use 
			of a relational database to capture the semantic links between data items.
			</li>
			<br>
		  
			<li> <strong>Reusable data objects and analysis logic</strong>. 
			For many - if not most - comparative genomic analyses, data preparation is nine
			tenths of the battle. The GLUE framework has been designed to ensure that 
			work spent preparing high-value data items such as multiple sequence alignments
			need only be performed once. Hosting of GLUE projects in an online version control 
			system such as GitHub allows for collaborative management of important data items
			and community testing of hypotheses.
			</li>
			<br>


			<li> <strong>Validation</strong>. 
			Building GLUE projects entails mapping the semantic links between data items
			(e.g. sequences, tabular data, multiple sequence alignments).
			This process provides an opportunity 
			for cross-validation, and thereby enforces a high level of data integrity.
			</li>
			<br>
		
			<li> <strong>Standardisation of the genomic co-ordinate space</strong>. GLUE
			projects allow all sequences to utilise the coordinate space of a chosen 
			reference sequence. Contingencies associated with insertions and deletions
			(indels) are handled in a systematic way.
			</li>
			<br>
		  
			<li> <strong>Predefined, fully annotated reference sequences</strong>:
			This project includes fully-annotated reference sequences for major lineages
			within the <i>Hepadnaviridae</i> family.
			</li>
			<br>
		  
			<li> <strong>Alignment trees</strong>:
			GLUE allows linking of alignments constructed at distinct taxonomic levels
			via an ""<b>alignment tree</b>"
			data structure. In the alignment tree, each alignment
			is constrained to a standard reference sequence, thus all multiple sequence
			alignments are linked to one another via a standardised coordinate system.
			</li>
			
		  </ol>
